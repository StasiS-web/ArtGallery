Art Gallery's main idea is to be an app for booking and sales. A place where regular users can book an exhibition or buy a painting. 2 roles: user and admin.

<strong> User: </strong>
* Can book an exhibition event in the Gallery or buy a painting from the app store.
* Can read Blog Posts and create comments on any Article.
* Cancel booked exhibition events or request orders cancellation. Once a User cancels, an already made order should be approved by the manager.
  
<strong> Admin: </strong>
* Can Create, Edit or delete FAQ.
* Can Create, Edit or delete Events 
* Can Manage Users, Edit, Roles.
  
<strong> :pushpin: Restrictions: </strong>
* Guest Vistors (a user who is not Logged-in) are restricted to browsing through exhibition events and painting in the App Store, also through the Blog Posts, which are available for them to read.
* Users are not allowed to create FAQ, Events, Blog Posts or new Arts for purchases only if they are Administrators.
* Any user can create Comments, make orders or book events as long as it is a Logged-in user. 
* Only Guest visitors are not allowed to create comments, make orders or book events.
* Only admin is allowed to create Blog Posts, Events or Arts.
