## :pushpin: How It Works
* Guest vistors: browse through events and Gallery Art Store. Also through the Blog Post thta are available to them for reading.

  - Once a Logger User to cancle already made order it is should be approved by the manager or admin
* Gallery Manager: confirm or decline user's booked event depends on Max Capacity for an event and controll what events are available for booking.
