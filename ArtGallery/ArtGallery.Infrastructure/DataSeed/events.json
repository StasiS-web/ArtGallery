    "Description": "The exhibition 'Art et Programmation', bringing together historical artists from the Denise Rene gallery and others from a younger generation, proposes a look at geometric abstraction through the notion of programming. Although it only officially appeared in the artistic landscape in 1962, with the exhibition 'Arte Programmata' in Italy, this notion covers aesthetic concerns whose sources are much earlier. It is present in filigree at the artists of the constructive avant-gardes who, aspiring to a form of universal art, depersonalize their creations, call for a connection between art and sciences."
