    "Content": "Most, but not all, of the art we sell on this site is destined for private homes. There's a 1964 ballad written by Bacharach and David originally recorded by Dionne Warwick, which explains, 'A house is not a home'. In the case of art, I would claim that a house is not a home, until there is some on the walls or displayed within. If you doubt me, why do all show homes and hotels, have paintings, or more likely prints, scattered about the rooms? Even the cheapest hotels will never have blank walls. It is because, they hope to make you feel at home and more welcoming as a result."

    "Content": "This week, pet owners show off their special animal friends on Love your Pet Day. Studies have shown that owning a pet can increase your chances of being happy and successful. In fact, of 1,000 pet owners studied, researchers found that they brought laughter to six in 10 owners and made seven in 10 feel more relaxed. As a nation of die-hard animal lovers, it's not surprising our furry (and feathery and scaly) friends make us happy. Animals are hugely popular subjects for artists, and why we have hundreds of paintings of all kinds of wildlife. Pets in art: Dogs and horses have always been incredibly popular in the history of art. Some of the earliest cave paintings ever discovered is of horses. Many years before horses were domesticated they were being carefully observed and recorded by humans. Renaissance artists painted their subjects with their dogs. Dogs symbolised loyalty, faithfulness, protection and love. One of the most well-known and recognised being Velazquez' 'Las Meninas' where a dog snoozes in the corner, or Jan Van Eyck's Arnolfini marriage where a puppy is at the forefront of the painting.

They just stuck out like a sore thumb! So I picked up some polymer clay at the craft store with the idea to create my own. Normally, I buy the 'name brand' polymer clay but this time, I was feeling cheap and decided to give the house brand a try. It was half the price and I have to say despite the fact that the yellow clay stained my hands a pinch, it worked great! I am used to stained hands so, no big deal!"

Fine if that is the look you are going for, but what if you want it to blend smoothly like an oil painting? I love oils, I love acrylics. If used right, you can't tell a difference between my oils and acrylics. That is a personal preference, you paint how you want, but if you want yours to look like mine, let me show you this tool along with a few very important warnings to help you get the best results!"
